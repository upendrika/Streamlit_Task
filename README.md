# Software Developer Salary Prediction App
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict software developer salaries based on real-world data from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey.

# Project Overview
In this project, I have:

Used real-world data from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020 to analyze various factors that influence software developer salaries.
Built and trained a machine learning model using the Scikit-learn library.
Developed an interactive web application using Streamlit that allows users to input their details and receive a salary prediction based on the trained model.

# Data
The data used in this project comes from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey. This dataset includes responses from developers around the world, covering various aspects such as:

Country,
Education level,
Years of professional coding experience,
Salary

# Model
The machine learning model was built using Scikit-learn, a popular Python library for machine learning. The model was trained to predict salaries based on the following inputs:

Country,
Education level,
Years of professional coding experience
